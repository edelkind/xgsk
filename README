X Grab Single Key

Grab the keyboard for a single KeyPress event.  Echo the key press on
stdout.

xgsk can optionally time out at a certain interval (given in
milliseconds), at which point nothing will be echoed to stdout
("timeout" will be echoed on stderr).

WHY, you ask?
Many window managers support key combinations, but not key chaining.
xgsk allows the users to add key chaining to their window manager of
choice with a small script.
